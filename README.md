## midgetv
midgetv is a RISC-V implementation written specifically for ice40*
FPGAs. The base ISA is RV32I. Standard extensions Zicsr and Zifencei
are always included. Standard extension C, M can be compiled in.

midgetv uses Wishbone b4 for interconnect.

### To use midgetv
Include [work/midgetv.v] into your project, and instantiate
`m_midgetv_core`. The program to run on the core is given by
parameters `prg00` through `prg0F`, usually generated by transforming
a binary RISC-V program with the utility `midgetv_bin2ebr`.
