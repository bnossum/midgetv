Here are quick and dirty RTL simulation models of Silicon Blue
constructs I use in midgetv. The reason these are in use is partly
historic - they were started many years ago. A much better strategy
would be to use Clifford Wolfs lovely simulation models, I will
probably switch to those in a future.
