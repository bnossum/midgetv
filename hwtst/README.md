### Hardware platforms with example(s) of use of midgetv

Currently I only own two platforms.

| Board            | Platform            | Comment |
| iceblink40-hx1k  | iceblink40-hx1k     | Near minimum size implementation |
|                  | max_iceblink40-hx1k | As large an implementation I can get into an iceblink40-hx1k board |
| upduino2         | upduino2            | "Reasonable" size midgetv inmplementation |
|                  | max_upduino2        | As large an implementation I can think of in an upduion2 board |
