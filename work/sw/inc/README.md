Some files are just to allow simulation of the riscv compliance test suite for rv32i:
- `compliance_io.h`
- `compliance_test.h`
- `midgetv_dump_compliance.S`
- `test_macros.h`

A minimal implementation of CSR instructions is in file `midgetv_minimal_csr.S`.

Inportant include files are `midgetv.inc` and `midgetv.h`.
